# Input

The HTML <input> element is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user. The semantics of an <input> varies considerably depending on the value of its type attribute.

## Available Classes

Styling can be applied in the following ways:

* `.base__input` - class
* `.base__input__[input-type]` as in `.base__input__text` - class
